</div>

<div>
<h3>Do you collect data or log chat/personal settings somewhere in the cloud?</h2>
<p>No. You log chat and save personal settings on your device. If streamers pay for us to host chat in the cloud, you can access that by clicking a button by  your own choice.</p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Does this work on the app?</h2>
<p>No, these features work on the website in the browser.</p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>How do I share a particular moment of a Rumble video?</h2>
<p>https://rumble.com/abc-123.html?start=300 will start 5 minutes into this video or previous livestream</p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>How do I click on timestamps of videos in the video comments below?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. A comment such as "Look at 3:21 into the video" will turn into a link to 3 minutes 21 seconds into the video upon loading.</p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>How do I view live stream chat after a live stream is over?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. Use this extension to log the chat, then you have several options afterwards. If you do not change the url afterwards, viewing the live stream page afterwards will load the chat you saved by clicking this extension menu button 🔄 . You can also use this extension menu to look at your "Saved Chats" and click on the stream title you wish to load. You can also use this extension menu to look at your "Saved Chats" and connect a stream title you wish to load to automatically load each time for this particular video. You can also use this extension menu to import a "Saved Chat" from someone else (or another platform) to load for this particular video. Finally, if a creator hosts the chats with us, you can load the chat in from the network and view it next to the past livestream. </p>
</h3>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Can I livestream on another platform and host my videos and livestream chats on Rumble?</h2>
<p>Yes. You can upload your videos by yourself and use this extension to export/import the livestream chats for each stream. For chat, we currently support Rumble, Kick, Youtube. Coming in 2023 hopefully are Twitch and Odysee time permitting.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Can I click on timestamps of past livestream messages?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. Yes. This technically works on Rumble or imported. Let's say the stream started at 7PM and there was a livestream message made at 7:14PM that seems interesting. Clicking this timestamp will fast-forward to 14 minutes into the video.</p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Can I theme my chat overlay in OBS to make it look how I want?</h2>
<p>Yes. Go to <a href="https:ramblerapp.github.io/theme_chat.html">Rumble Chat Theme Generator</a>. You can make certain selections of background colors and fonts and sizes and show/hide certain elements. It will generate code at the bottom of the page which you can copy and paste into your OBS browser source for chat. You may have to manually fine tune it yourself.</p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Can I search past live stream chat to find certain good moments?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. Yes. You can search by current stream or all saved chats. You can search past livestream chat by username, event, or keyword. You do not need the internet or network connection for this, its on your device.</p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Can I theme/mute livestream chat to make it look how I want, like mute certain words/phrases or users or bots, and highlight certain words/phrases or users?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. Yes. </p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Does this work on alternative, obscure, or older Android phones?</h2>
<p>Yes. It could be a standard Samsung phone, or it could be unlocked or modded or something else because you are a techie type person that likes to tinker with things. Good luck, this has been tested on a couple of those type of devices and it works just as well as any standard phone you can buy at Best Buy. </p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Can I delete or export old livestream chats?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. Yes. You can stream while saving the video and livestream chat to your hard drive, then once the live stream is done, export them to an external hard drive and delete them from the internet and your computer if you so choose.</p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>I can't see very well. Can I make the chat large size, and have it flow on top of the video while the video is full screen?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. Yes. </p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>My hand(s) are busy while watching the livestream. Does this add keyboard commands and voice commands to make things happen like full screen or search chat without using the mouse?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. Yes. </p>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Is mentioning other users or replying available on mobile yet?</h2>
<p>By using this extension. Yes. </p>
</h3>
</div>

                <h3>Why isn't this on the Chrome Web Store?</h3>
                <p>We believe in the true open-source nature of this project and idea. Upon downloading, you or someone you trust can inspect the code for anything malicious. You can modify it to suit your needs. You or someone you know are probably smarter than I and can take this and improve upon it. This exists to be an open place of stream ideas in which people can add or subtract to and progress upon. With is as our motto, the best way seemingly to accomplish this is to provide it like this.</p>

                <h3>Don't like it?</h3>
                <p>If you do not like it, you can disable or uninstall it with no issues. All features can be turned on and off individually -- you choose which you want to use and how.</p>

                <p>No, and it never will unless others do it.</p>

                <h3>Is this coming to the app?</h3>
                <p>No, this is not related to Rumble (the company who makes the apps) in any way.</p>

                <h3>I use the app?</h3>
                <p>That is fine. This is for the website rumble.com . It is easier to launch, test and fix any issues quicker on the website whether mobile or desktop.</p>

                <h3>Creation</h3>
                <p>This was written by a single person in the USA.</p>

                <h3>Storage/tracking/security</h3>
                <p>This extension saves information to your browser locally if you choose such as options/preferences you set, chat that you save, and browser version which you can export out to yourself via CSV file and is deleted when you uninstall the extension. We save none of your options/preferences "in the cloud" at this time.  We currently use no tracking or advertising or cookies at this time of 4/2023. This may change and you will be notified if it does. We are currently a very small team and do not have time or resources for large privacy policy scope or legal/public relations/social/customer service policy other than to provide the basic technical features needed to the streamers for their usage.</p>

                <h3>Third Party Usage</h3>
                <p>This currently does make usage of one third-party software or libraries in 2023 -- Papa Parse https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse.</p>

                <h3>Source/Funding</h3>
                <p>This is currently funded/hosted 100% by the creator/developer, who is a person not associated with any live streaming or video/media company in any formal way. If this changes, we will update here.</p>

                <h3>Version</h3>
                <p>This is released under Google Chrome Manifest version 3 (2023) and may only work with browsers/operating systems updated in 2022 and beyond. This is released under GNU 3 license https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html. </p>

                <h3>Usage and functionality</h3>
                <p>This provides functionality that can be used via the TAB and ENTER keys on the keyboard, a pop-up menu which can be used via touch or mouse, voice commands, and keyboard keybind commands. Each of these can be turned on or off as requested.</p>

              <h2>Usage</h2>
              <p>
                
                <p>For this documentation, "livestream" will refer to the live video on https://rumble.com .</p>

                <h3>Basic Usage on Rumble LiveStreams:</h3>
                <h5>Load an active livestream with chat on Rumble</h5>
                if this is working, you will see loading messages pop up in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.<br />
                in the top right corner of your browser, you will see either a puzzle piece icon or a green keyboard icon. Click on it.<br />
                if puzzle piece, click on the pin icon next to the Rambler green keyboard icon.<br />
                if you see the green keyboard icon, click on it to toggle the extension Main Menu.<br />

                <h5>Main Menu</h5>
                The menu with the icons the extension provides we will call the "Main Menu". This can be toggled in view or hidden. <br />
                On desktop, the Main Menu toggles on the right side of the chat.<br />
                On mobile, the Main Menu toggles below the video.<br />
                The main menu provides access to the options menu at its top, and different one-time chat toggle features below that. <br />
                From top to bottom, here are the icons in the Main Menu and their actions:<br />

                <ul>

                <h3>FEATURES EXPLAINED IN DEPTH</h3>

<h5>Basic Keybinds</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
You can start using ALT+1, ALT+2, ALT+3, ALT+4 for controlling chat and screen commands on your desktop/laptop.<br />
This is not recommended while gaming and streaming on same keyboard.<br />

You can change these browser keybinds at chrome://extensions/shortcuts <br />
but initially, here is what they are when you turn them on in this extension <br />

<strong>Keybinds</strong><br />
Alt+1 = show/hide live stream chat <br />
Alt+2 = show/hide recorded live stream chat <br />
Alt+3 = search this live stream chat <br />
Alt+4 = search all recorded live stream chat <br />

<h5>Full Keybinds</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
You can start using ALT+Q, ALT+W, etc... for controlling chat and screen commands on your desktop/laptop <br />
This is not recommended while gaming and streaming on same keyboard. <br />

<strong>Keybinds</strong><br />
ALT+Top Row Keyboard corresponds to the MAIN MENU left to right.<br />
For example, the far left MAIN MENU icon toggles broadcaster messages,<br /> 
and the far left keyboard key, ALT+Q, also toggles broadcaster messages.<br />
And the keys continuing right (W,E,R...) map to moving right on the MAIN MENU.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Keybinds</strong><br />
ALT+Bottom Row Keyboard corresponds to the OPTIONS MENU.<br />
ALT+Left Shift toggles the MAIN MENU<br />
ALT+Z toggles the OPTIONS MENU<br />
And the keys continuing right (X,C,V...) map to different sections of the OPTIONS MENU.<br />


<h5>Voice Commands</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
In the desktop/laptop Google Chrome version of the extension, you can test out using voice commands for controlling chat and screen commands<br />
This is very experimental, use at your own risk. <br />
This is not recommended while gaming and streaming on same keyboard. <br />
This uses some computer memory, so if you are lagging, turn this off to save memory. <br />

<strong>Commands</strong><br />
computer toggle chat<br />
computer search chat<br />
computer search all chat<br />
computer chat top<br />
computer chat bottom<br />


<h5>Text to speech keywords</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
Perhaps you are lurking or not actively reading every chat message, but would like to be alerted if someone in chat says a keyword.<br />
Your desktop/laptop Google Chrome browser can speak a chat message out loud that contains a word(s) you specify.<br />
This is very experimental, use at your own risk. Don't use very common words like hello/lol/etc. <br />
This uses some computer memory, so if you are lagging, turn this off to save memory. <br />

<h5>Auto-Saving Chat</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
Chat is automatically logged/saved to this device (in the browser) as it displays on a live stream, so you can read it back later.<br />
This uses some computer memory, so if you are lagging, turn this off to save memory. <br />

<h5>Auto-Showing Chat</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
Chat is automatically displayed on the video on a live stream instead of on the sidebar. <br />
It turns your desktop/laptop into full screen mode where you see a full screen video and the chat flowing over top of it.<br />
This uses some computer memory, so if you are lagging, turn this off to save memory. <br />

<h5>Left Handed Chat</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
Chat is on the left side of the video instead of the right side. <br />

<h5>Upside Down Chat</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
Chat is displayed newest at the top, oldest at the bottom. This is opposite of the current "flow down" chat. <br />

<h5>Mouseover</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
When you place your mouse cursor over the chat or emojis, they enlarge in size so that you can see them better. <br />

<h5>Saved Chats</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
While watching the current stream and chat, you can browse or search previous chats that you have saved or imported. Example: you can refer to previous conversations or continue on conversations and updates from day to day and stream to stream to build community.<br />
You can export chats in CSV format so that you can use in personal spreadsheet or database.<br />
Example: you can make custom analytics for yourself by exporting the chats out into a custom program where you can analyze how many raids you get per day, how many unique chatters per day, if/how many staff or verified users you had chatting, or whatever you can think of in a spreadsheet/database macro/formula/script.<br />

<h5>Import Chats</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
You can import chats to view or search from other Rumble streams or past streams on Twitch, Youtube, or Kick.<br />

<h5>Share</h5>
By turning on this feature...<br />
You can make your own share menu to use for your needs. For example, maybe you want a one click share your clips to your Discord server, your Minds account, your own website, or whatever you want. You can customize the share menu included to contain what you use. <br />

                This browser extension supplies a number of features for past streams on Rumble, also known as VODS. <br />
                For this documentation, "video" will refer to a VOD/Video On Demand/Previous Stream/Replay at https://Rumble.com/abc-something.html . <br />
                Some of these requested features are click on timestamps in comments, share links to specific parts of the video, and view chat on replay.
              </p>

              <h3>View previously saved chat on a video manually:</h3>
                1a) watch a live stream and log the chat using this extension. <br />
                1b) or have someone give you the exported chat file they exported from a stream using this extension. <br />
                2a) load and watch the video the chat is from. <br />
                2b) Manually import the chat to view using this extension "Import Chat" in the options menu.
                3) You can now watch the video replay while reading the chat from it.
              <hr />

              <h3>Opening timestamped Rumble videos</h3>
                Open a video such as example: https://Rumble.com/a1b2?t=120 <br />
                The video should start playing 2 minutes in from the beginning according to that timestamp link. 120 seconds = 2 minutes<br />
                If you are using the extension, using ?t=seconds in a link will play the video that many seconds into the video.
              <hr />

              <h3>Sharing timestamped Rumble video</h3>
                Open a video such as example: https://Rumble.com/a1b2 <br />
                Watch until some time in the video <br />
                If you are using the extension, open the options menu and click the SHARE category. <br />
                Click the "Share" button below to copy the general link to this video. <br />
                Click the "Share" button below again to copy the link to this specific time in the video. <br />
                Example: it will copy something like https://Rumble.com/a1b2?t=505 . <br />
                Paste this link somewhere else, or use the share menu to directly share it to a social platform.
              <hr />

              <h3>Timestamp links on Rumble comments</h3>
                Open a video with some comments such as example: https://Rumble.com/a1b2 <br />
                Play the video. <br />
                If you see a comment below with a timestamp, such as "2:34 good point!", click on one. <br />
                The video should start playing fast-forwarding to the time in the video of the timestamp -- in this case at the 2:34 mark.<br />
              <hr />

              <h3>Scrolling, filtering, searching, etc...</h3>
              On chat replays on videos, you are able to use most of the livestream functionality of Rambler to theme, scroll, filter, search, etc the chat on it to find particular chats or moments you have been looking for.
